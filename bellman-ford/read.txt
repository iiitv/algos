Bellman ford helps one to find the shortest distance from one point in a graph to all other points. This might be
same as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm but BellmanFord works for negative edges as well.

Initially all the nodes connected directly ( although this might depend on order of insertion ) to the source get
updated with the distance. Then in the second iteration all 2-edge long vertices get updated. This continues till
every node gets updated.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm propagates correct distance estimates to all nodes in a graph in V-1 steps, unless there
is a negative weight cycle. If there is a negative weight cycle, you can go on relaxing its nodes indefinitely.
